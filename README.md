This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Sudoku puzzle game. It allows users to play Sudoku on a graphical interface, providing an interactive and engaging way to solve puzzles. The game includes features such as real-time input validation, grid generation, and solution checking to ensure the puzzle follows standard Sudoku rules. The project demonstrates strong application of object-oriented programming principles and algorithmic logic for puzzle validation and solving. It serves as a great example of combining problem-solving with user-friendly interface design in Java. This project can be extended further to include features like difficulty levels, automatic puzzle generation, and solution hints.
